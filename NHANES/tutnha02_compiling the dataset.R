  # For example, combining the 2015-2016 and 2017-March 2020 files would result in a data file representing a 5.2-year period, and the survey weights should be adjusted as follows: 
  # 2015-2016 survey weights should be multiplied by 2/5.2 (the fraction of the 5.2-year period represented by the 2015-2016 cycle) and
